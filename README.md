# Python Trivia Game
Python GUI for playing trivia wrapped into a Mac application. (Sorry, MacOS only )

---

## How To Play 
To play, simply open the trivia app like you would open any other app. [[Write about Apple's warning for unverified developers. Add pics too]]

---

### TODO:

#### Visual
- Nothing for now :) 

#### Functional
	
- Make a MacOS application that can be played without depending on the user's python environment
- Allow the user to input a question number to start on

	- Turn "PlayTrivia" function into a class. The internal functions will become methods. Counter, seconds, questionOrder, ... will become a class attribute

---

### DONE:
- Set a common seed for everyone and let users jump to a specific question number when they start the game
- Change backgrond color (dark mode)
- Make each window pop up in the same place
- Allow keyboard keys to flip card and move to next card
- Make buttons (and button text larger)
- Countdown timer
- Have current slide's timer stop when next card is queued before current card's timer is up
