### DONE
	- Change backgrond color (dark mode)
	- Make each window pop up in the same place
	- Allow keyboard keys to flip card and move to next card
	- Make buttons (and button text larger)
	- Countdown timer
	- Have current slide's timer stop when next card is queued before current card's timer is up
